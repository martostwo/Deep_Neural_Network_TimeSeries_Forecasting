# Deep Neural Network fot time series forecasting.

A deep neural network-based model for time series prediction.

⚠️Disclaimer: Optimum select and best combination algorithms may introduce overfitting. If you use it, be sure to implement a system to correct for selection bias, overfitting, and non-normality to ensure model robustness.
This is example code for educational purposes. Under no circumstances put these models into production because the probability of losing money is too high.⚠️
